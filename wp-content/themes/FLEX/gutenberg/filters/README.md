# FLEX (Flexible Layout System): Filters

[Wordpress Docs](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/filters/)

Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code. They provide one way for plugins and themes interact with the editor, but theyâ€™re also used extensively by WordPress Core itself.

There are two types of hooks: Actions and Filters. In addition to PHP actions and filters, WordPress also provides a mechanism for registering and executing hooks in JavaScript. This functionality is also available on npm as the @wordpress/hooks package, for general purpose use.
