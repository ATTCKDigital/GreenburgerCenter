# FLEX (Flexible Layout Experience)
A parent theme for FLEX WordPress projects

READ [__GET_STARTED_HERE](https://github.com/ATTCKDigital/FLEX/tree/master/__GET_STARTED_HERE) BEFORE cloning!

## Theme Structure

### FLEX Theme
The FLEX theme is a parent theme that sets a varierty of default configurations and base theme files. When a new project is started, a child theme is created specific to the project. 

All changes should be made in the child theme. If a change to the parent theme is required, create a feature branch in the `FLEX` submodule and submit a pull request detailing why the change was necessary and any possible red flags or repercussions to existing FLEX projects.

### Components Structure
Components are the pieces of the theme. These pieces include such things as the nav, the footer, reusable partials (share tools, social media bar, content feeds, etc). Components are NOT part of Gutenberg Blocks.

Each component folder contains the following, specific to the component:
- markup (php file)
- sass file
- js file (if component has js aspect)
- readme.md specific to component (if needed)

See detailed README.md in [`components`[(https://github.com/ATTCKDigital/FLEX/tree/master/components)] folder.

#### Including a Component
Components can be included in any template file.

The `Utils::render_template()` function should be used to include all files.

See example of how to include a template in the README.md in `components` folder.

### Blocks
Wordpress 5.0+ uses Gutenberg as an editing interface. This interface is comprised of `blocks`.  FLEX uses a custom block system based on the row/column grid paradigm. 

The FLEX theme comes with a standard set of blocks. Per project, custom blocks can be created via ACF. See the readme in the sample child theme in the `gutenberg` folder for additional information.


### Assets
Assets include fonts, images and svgs. ~~SVGs are compiled by gulp into a global SVG file.~~ (SVG Sprite is still in development). SVGs should be used wherever possible.

### Global CSS
The `scss` folder holds all of the globally available styles for the site. Things such as grids, headline styles, layout styles, etc.

These should serve as the basis for a functioning theme. Changes should be made to the files that set parameters/vars only (colors, fonts, general typography and iconography). Some items have variables that can be changed (such as the padding and margins sass files).

### Global JS
The boilerplate theme has a variety of existing javascript functions (nav animation, parallax, scroll detection, etc). These can be leveraged from any component using ES6 import. See `Available Global JS Components` in `js` folder for detailed information on each function.
